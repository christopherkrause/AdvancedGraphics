Project Title
_____________

> Skateboarding Robot via Hierarchical Modeling


Program description.
____________________

> The concepts of hierarchical modeling and object instancing are explored by craeting an
> animated robot. Each component or piece of the robot is a simple polygon. These shapes
> are then transformed via instancing creating the whole. Using three basic functions,
> translate, rotate and scale, simple objects are moved, rotated and shrunken/enlarged
> to create a hierarchy of robot parts all moving in unison via WebGL rendered to a HTML5
> canvas.


Skateboarding Robot Design and Animation
______________________

> The robot began to take shape when the modeling of objects and thier instancing were fully
> understood. Once the initial few were created and imiplemented it was quite fun and
> artistically pleasing to get creative with my project. I began creativity when I decided to
> try and create a moving dial for the robots heart. This was done with the instancing of the
> joint(circle) and creating a dial that drastically rotated in comparison of the yaw of
> the robot. This rotation model also helped with electrifying the antenna and made for
> realistic moving skateboard wheels.
