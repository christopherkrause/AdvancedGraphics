Reflection and Shadows

Program description.
____________________

This program renders various custom objects and applies to them their reflection and shadow.

Utilizing the supplied revolve perl script the objects were easily made by rotating polygons mapped out on paper.
I began with the idea of creating a candlestick and applying Perlin Noise to create a flame but that became to difficult
but I will continue on my own free time.

Once I figured out how to create one object on a table it then the project became creative with the only barriers
for shapes being that I was creating them with the revolve function and adding textures to them and it was quite fun.

I utilized instancing by scaling the candle object in various ways to create the cork, cigarette, label on the winebottle and the wick for the candle.

****UPDATE****
I have got the moving Perlin Noise flame working and am resubmitting. It may cause some lagging so if it gets bad just refresh. I opted out of having the flame move on start up since after about 30 seconds the lag is noticeable. Once you
move the scene with a mouse event the flame will begin to flicker.
