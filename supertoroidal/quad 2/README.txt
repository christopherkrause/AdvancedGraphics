Project Title
_____________

Super Quadratic Surface 
featuring Martian Tempurature Map


Program description.
____________________

This program begins by drawing a simple wireframe superquadratic mesh. Gauraud shading is used and utilizing 
the provided quadratic formulas the texture mapping is computed. 
Utilizing most of my code from the super torodial and following some of the inclass examples for texture mapping 
the next step was choose an image and feature such as allowing the user to move the surface or animate. 
I chose to allow the user to move the shape(already had that coded) and tried to get a radio set up so the user could 
change the image. I eventually ran out of time and must submit what I have and chose a Nasa Maritan Tempurature Map. 

I may mess with the radio buttons and submit late but that depends on extra time. 

I had a Title for my webpage but thought the space background was way too cool. Please comment out the 
background image if you want to see the header and footer. I didnt have time to make sytle sheets to bring the text
to the front. Again I will work on it and submit late if I have the time. The space background is just rad.
